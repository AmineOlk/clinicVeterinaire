# Create a Managed Identity and give it access to your Key Vault

You now have the CSI driver installed, as a next step you will need to allow access from your AKS nodes to your Key Vault. We will use the _System Assigned Managed Identity_ of the AKS Virtual Machine Scale Set.

- [system assigned MI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-identity-access#use-a-system-assigned-managed-identity)

{: .note }
> Using the cluster Managed Identity for connecting to the Key Vault service should not be used when your cluster is used by multiple applications that don't share a security context. In that case connecting to the Key Vault with an identity per application security context is the more secure setup.

## Step by step guidance

1. Each AKS cluster also contains resources in a managed resource group. This is also where the Virtual Machine Scale Set lives. Use the below commang to get a reference to this resource group.

```bash
MANAGED_RESOURCE_GROUP=$(az aks show -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKSCLUSTER --query nodeResourceGroup --output tsv)
```

1. Next, get the name of the node pool.

```bash
NODE_POOL_NAME=$(az vmss list -g $MANAGED_RESOURCE_GROUP --query [].name --output tsv)
```

1. You can now use the info on the managed resource group and the node pool to get at the managed identity client ID. This command is taking the second client id of the scale set, this is the one used by the key vault provider.

```bash
CLIENT_ID=$(az vmss identity show -g $MANAGED_RESOURCE_GROUP  -n $NODE_POOL_NAME --query "userAssignedIdentities.*.clientId | [1]" -o tsv)
```

1. You will now give this identity permissions to get keys secrets and certificates from your Key Vault.

```bash
az keyvault set-policy -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $KEYVAULT_NAME --key-permissions get --spn $CLIENT_ID
az keyvault set-policy -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $KEYVAULT_NAME --secret-permissions get --spn $CLIENT_ID
az keyvault set-policy -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $KEYVAULT_NAME --certificate-permissions get --spn $CLIENT_ID
```
