# Examine the application components based on the information provided in its GitHub repository

To start, you will learn about the existing Spring Petclinic application.

1. Navigate to the [src folder of the GitHub repo of this lab](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab/tree/main/src) and review the README.md file.

1. Examine the information about [starting services locally without Docker](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-without-docker), [Starting services locally with docker-compose](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-with-docker-compose), and [Starting services locally with docker-compose and Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-with-docker-compose-and-java). If time permits, consider launching the application locally using either of these methods.

1. In the web browser displaying the GitHub repo, navigate to each folder containing the code of the individual spring-petclinic-* services and review their content. You don't need to know their full details, but you should understand their basic structure.

1. Make sure you create a local copy of this project for you to work in during the lab. You may also want to push this local copy to a git repository you own.

## Step by step guidance

1. On your lab computer, start a web browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one by navigating to [the Join GitHub page](https://github.com/join) and following the instructions provided on [the Signing up for a new GitHub account page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

1. Navigate to the [GitHub repository of this lab](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aks-lab) and select **Fork**.

1. Make sure your own username is indicated as the fork `Owner`

1. Select **Create fork**. This will create a copy or fork of this project in your own account.

   > In case you are using a GitHub EMU account, it might be you are not able to fork a public repository. In that case, create a new repository with the same name, clone the original repository, add your new repository as a remote and push to this new remote.

### Using Codespaces

In case you want to use a [GitHub CodeSpace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for running though this lab follow the below guidance.

1. Navigate to the newly forked GitHub project.

1. Select **Code** and next **Codespaces**.

1. Select **Create a codespace**.

   Your codespace will now get created in your browser window. Once creation is done, navigate into the `/src` directory and you can start executing the next steps of the lab. 

### Using a local setup or Visual Studio Code Remote Containers

In case you use a local setup of all the tooling for running though this lab follow the below guidance.

1. On your lab computer, in the Git Bash window, run the following commands to clone your fork of the spring-petclinic-microservices project to your workstation. Make sure to replace `<your-github-account>` in the below command:

   ```bash
   mkdir workspaces
   cd workspaces
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/java-microservices-aks-lab.git
   ```

1. When prompted to sign in to GitHub, select the **Sign in with your browser** option. This will automatically open a new tab in the web browser window, prompting you to provide your GitHub username and password.

1. In the browser window, enter your GitHub credentials, select **Sign in**, and, once successfully signed in, close the newly opened browser tab.

1. In workspaces folder double check that the spring petclinic application got cloned correctly. You can use the repository in your workspaces folder to regularly push your changes to.

1. Navigate into the `java-microservices-aks-lab/src` folder that got created.

   ```bash
   cd java-microservices-aks-lab/src
   ```

1. Open the project with Visual Studio Code

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

1. In case you have the [Visual Studio Code Remote Containers plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) installed, you can now open the project in a remote container. This will reopen the project in a docker container with all the tooling installed.
