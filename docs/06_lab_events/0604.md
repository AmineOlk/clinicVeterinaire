# Inspect telemetry data being received

To conclude this lab, you will run the producer app to send 100 events to your event hub and use output logs of the customers microservice to verify that these messages are being received.

Start the producer locally and in the mean time inspect the logs of the customers service to check events coming in and being processed.

## Step by step guidance

1. In the Git Bash window, set the current working directory to the `events` folder and run the `TestProducer` application.

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/quickstart/java/producer
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="TestProducer"
   ```

1. Verify that the output indicates that 100 events were sent to the `telemetry` event hub.

1. Press the `Ctrl+C` key combination to return to the command prompt.

1. In your command prompt, start the log stream output for the _customers-service_.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl logs customers-service-65d987f697-pd79d
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the events from the event hub were being picked up.
